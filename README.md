The motivation behind the creation of this library is taking its start from the genuinely simple idea: "**I don't want to use pytesseract or some other non-amazon-specific OCR services, nor do I want to install some executables to just solve a captcha. I desire to get a solution with 2 lines of code without any heavy add-ons, using a pure Python.**"

## Recent News
+ *May 5, 2023*: tested and approved compatibility with Pillow 9.5.0
+ *January 25, 2022*: tested and approved compatibility with Python 3.10
+ *January 25, 2022*: dropped support for Python 3.6

## Installation
You can simply install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/) using **pip**. For more methods check the [docs](https://amazoncaptcha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
```bash
pip install amazoncaptcha
```

## Quick Snippet
An example of the constructor usage. Scroll a bit down to see some tasty class methods. **For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use `fromlink` class method**.
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha

captcha = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg')
solution = captcha.solve()

# Or: solution = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg').solve()
```

## Usage and Class Methods
Browsing Amazon using `selenium` and stuck on captcha? The class method below will do all the dirty work of extracting an image from the webpage for you. Practically, it takes a screenshot from your webdriver, crops the captcha and stores it into bytes array which is then used to create an `AmazonCaptcha` instance. This also means avoiding any local savings. **For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use `fromlink` class method instead of `fromdriver`**.
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified example
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)
solution = captcha.solve()
```

If you are not using `selenium` or the previous method is not just the case for you, it is possible to use a captcha link directly. This class method will request the url, check the content type and store the response content into bytes array to create an instance of `AmazonCaptcha`.
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha

link = 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/captcha/usvmgloq/Captcha_kwrrnqwkph.jpg'

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromlink(link)
solution = captcha.solve()
```

In addition, if you are a machine learning or neural network developer and are looking for some training data, check [this](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazon-captcha-database) repository, which was created to store images and other non-script data for the solver.

## Help the Development
If you are willing to help the development, consider setting `keep_logs` argument of the `solve` method to `True`. Here is the example, if you are using `fromdriver` class method. If set to `True`, all the links of the unsolved captcha will be stored so that later you can [open the issue and send the logs](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha/issues/new?assignees=a-maliarov&labels=training+data&template=send_logs.md&title=Add+training+data).
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified example
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)
solution = captcha.solve(keep_logs=True)
```
